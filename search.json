Just click the link and follow along.\n\n\n\nBinder\n\n\n\nHow long will my Binder session last?\nBinder will automatically shut down user sessions that have more than 10 minutes of inactivity (if you leave a jupyterlab window open in the foreground, this will generally be counted as “activity”). Binder tries to guarentee that active sessions will last up to 6 hours.\n\n\nWhat if my session shuts down during a break?\nWe will start from a fresh checkpoint after every break, so if your Binder session ends, you can just restart a new session and the beginning of the next section.\nIf you would like to run this tutorial locally on your own computer, please follow the instructions below."
