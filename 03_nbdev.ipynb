This is a much less complex introduction than the nbdev end-to-end walkthrough, because we won't create a whole package that can be uploaded to PyPi or Anaconda.

    "You might be wondering, other than markdown cells, why wouldn't we want to always export our code cells? This is a fair question. If you clean up your notebooks after you are done developing the code, you might not see the utitlity here yet. But the real value of being able to exclude code cells lies in the ability to tell the story of how your code came into it's final form. Instead of cleaning up your notebooks when you have achieved your coding goal, you can leave in all the valuable information you left behind along the way. This could include design planning and decision making. \n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever been looking at old code and scoffed at the way you designed something? Maybe you decide to go clean it up, only to gradually realize that you've made this mistake before. There was a reason you left in this ugly solution, wasn't there! Now you've wasted a lot of time because you didn't take the time to record your decision-making the first time. Of course, you may log your thoughts in GitHub issues, but leaving behind your logical process in the notebook will make sure that you don't loose track of it down the road. Your thoughts and decisions remain transparent for your future self, or that lucky person that inherits all your code. \n",

And again, this is helpful for another developer or our future-selves who may be trying to read our code. They don't have to hold as many variables in their head, because they can see the steps broken down and read the intermediate values without having to use a debugger. Let's try out this implicit benefit for ourselves below."
