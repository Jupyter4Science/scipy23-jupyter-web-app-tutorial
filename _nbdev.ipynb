    "`nbdev` sounds pretty cool, but there's also a lot going on there. Maybe you haven't even heard of continuous integration before. In this notebook we will go over how to use modular nbdev to create a python module. This is a much less complex introduction than the nbdev end-to-end walkthrough, because we won't create a whole package that can be uploaded to PyPi or Anaconda. We will simply use notebooks to create clean python modules that we can use to build our dashboards and web apps. \n",
