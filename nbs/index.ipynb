    "# How the Little Jupyter Notebook Became a Web App: A Tutorial for Making Your Code and Data More Accessible and Reusable\n",
    "\n",
    "> Already familiar with ipywidgets, but ready to take your skills to the next level? In this tutorial we walk through what it takes to transform an exploratory Jupyter Notebook into a mature web application. Web apps can be a valuable product of collaboration between researchers and software developers, and the packages used in this tutorial were selected to support this relationship, starting with using JupyterLab as an integrated development environment. Attendees will learn how to design and document a scientific web application that accommodates increasing complexity, but is also inheritable by the researchers who maintain them in the long run.\n",
