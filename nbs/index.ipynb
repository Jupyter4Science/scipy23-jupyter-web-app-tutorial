    "Live tutorial online and in person 29 Jun 2023 - 10:00am to 3:00pm AZ in the Life Sciences Center A on the ASU Tempe Campus. [Signup information here](https://researchacademy.asu.edu/events/2023-06-29/how-little-jupyter-notebook-became-web-app-making-your-code-and-data-more).\n",

    "> Are you running a research workflow from a Jupyter Notebook? \n",
    "> In this tutorial, we walk through what it takes to transform an exploratory Jupyter Notebook into a standalone data dashboard or mature web application.  Web applications can be incredibly valuable for communicating your research by making your data and code more accessible and sharable. Attendees will learn how best to design and document a scientific web application that is easier to pass along to new lab members and doesn’t turn into spaghetti as they increase in complexity."
